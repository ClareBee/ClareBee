## 😊&nbsp; About Me


You might notice 2020 is largely tumbleweed on my commit history...😅&nbsp; 

That's not because I quit... Well, I _did_ take time out at the start of the year to travel Scotland in a van 🚐,&nbsp; - but Coronavirus put the breaks on that plan!

The sudden drop-off of little green squares this year is because my work repos are all on Bitbucket & in my free time I've been clicking buttons on the AWS management console to prep for the AWS Developer Associate Certification, instead of shipping code!

**2021 I'm going to get back into it on here, so watch this space...**

<br />

## 🏗&nbsp; Currently working on

Gatsby, TypeScript, AWS & Cypress for a great company in Edinburgh.

<br />

## 📚&nbsp; Currently learning

Serverless, Next.js (& determined to overcome imposter syndrome by finally getting to grips with some proper Bash scripting...).

<br />

## 📫&nbsp; Online

Often on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/clarie_bee">Twitter</a> doing #100DaysOfCode & #100DaysOfCloud - & liking all the dog photos 🐶
